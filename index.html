	<p>The name Woolstencroft first arose amongst the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. It is derived from their having lived at Woolstencroft in the county of Cheshire. Further research revealed that the name is derived from the Old English personal name Wulfstan and the Old English word croft, meaning paddock, farm or enclosure, or holm, meaning area of dry land. The name thus translates as the dweller at Wulfstan's farm.
