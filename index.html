  <p>The name <span class='emphasis'>Woolstencroft</span> first arose amongst the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. It is derived from their having lived at Woolstencroft in the county of Cheshire. 
  <br><br>
  Further research revealed that the name is derived from the Old English personal name <span class='emphasis'>Wulfstan</span> and the Old English word <span class='emphasis'>croft</span>, meaning paddock, farm or enclosure. The name thus translates as <span class='emphasis'>the dweller at Wulfstan's farm</span>.
